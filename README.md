# angular-e2e-test-recorder
Records e2e tests for both angular and angular 2.

This records the ways you interact with an angular application, and then generates the code to playback these actions and 
 test results in an e2e test with protractor. The idea is to save you time writing these tests by hand.
 
You should only add this script to your app when your app behaves as
expected (happy flow) as then you will have the tests generated for expected behaviour

###Current UI interactions that are recorded for acceptance tests:

* Button clicks, they also generate andThen code blocks. 
* Record any changes to route
* Changes in DOM additions/removals, only items with ID's are recorded and that don't have the doNotRecord css class.

```
If you don't want an element to be recorded, and any of its children add this class to it `doNotRecord`

##TIPS

Avoid making multiple button clicks (or other interactions that cause asynchronous) updates until DOM has 
finished updating. This will allow code generated by the mutations observer to be placed in the in the
generated code.
